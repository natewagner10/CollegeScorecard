# Legos Project

As a part of Data Munging and Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Science (CAP5320) for New College of Florida's Master of Data Science program, we were required to ask and answer some questions on the College Scorecard Dataset. Here we explored the relationships between graduation rates and other variables.

## Dataset

We used the [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) dataset.
